### Branch policy

Fedify follows a structured branching strategy for managing releases and
maintenance:

#### Branch types

 -  **next**: Contains unreleased development for the next major version.
 -  **main**: Contains unreleased development for the next minor version.
 -  **x.y-maintenance**: Maintenance branches for released major/minor versions
    (e.g., *1.5-maintenance*, *1.6-maintenance*).

#### Target branches

 -  **Breaking changes**: Target the *next* branch.
 -  **New features**: Target the *main* branch.
 -  **Bug fixes**: Target the oldest applicable maintenance branch that contains
    the bug.

#### Release and merge strategy

When a bug is fixed in a maintenance branch:

 1. Fix the bug in the oldest affected maintenance branch
    (e.g., *1.5-maintenance*).
 2. Create a new patch release tag (e.g., `1.5.1`).
 3. Merge the fix into the next maintenance branch (e.g., *1.6-maintenance*).
 4. Create a new patch release tag for that branch (e.g., `1.6.1`).
 5. Continue merging forward through all subsequent maintenance branches.
 6. Merge into *main*.
 7. Finally merge into *next*.

This ensures that all maintenance branches and the development branches
include the fix.

### Bug fix

If you want to fix a bug in Fedify, please search the [GitHub issue tracker] to
see if the bug has already been reported.  If it hasn't been reported yet,
please open a new issue to discuss the bug.

When you open a pull request, please provide the issue number that the pull
request is related to.

A patch set should include the following:

 -  The regression test that demonstrates the bug.  It should fail without the
    patch and pass with the patch.
 -  The fix for the bug.
 -  The *CHANGES.md* entry.  The entry should include the issue number,
    the pull request number, and your name (unless you want to be anonymous).

Bug fix pull requests should target the most oldest maintenance branch that
the bug affects.  If you are not sure which branch to target, please ask in the
issue tracker.

### Feature implementation

If you want to contribute to Fedify, please open a new issue in the [GitHub
issue tracker] to discuss the change you want to make.  If the change is
accepted, you can start working on the change.  When you open a pull request,
please provide the following information:

 -  The issue number that the pull request is related to.
 -  The description of the change.
 -  The reason why the change is needed.

 -  The implementation of the feature.
 -  If any API change was made, the documentation update for the API.
 -  Check if examples work with the change, and update the examples if needed.
 -  The *CHANGES.md* entry.  The entry should include the issue number,
    the pull request number, and your name (unless you want to be anonymous).

Feature pull requests should target the *main* branch for non-breaking changes,
or the *next* branch for breaking changes.

### Adding a new package

When adding a new package to the monorepo, the following files must be updated:

**Required updates:**

 1. *AGENTS.md* and *CONTRIBUTING.md*: Add the package to the repository
    structure list.
 2. *README.md*: Add the package to the "Packages" section table.
 3. *.github/workflows/build.yaml*: Update the PR comment in the `publish` job
    (around the `thollander/actions-comment-pull-request` action).
 4. Root *deno.json*: Add the package path to the `workspace` array.
 5. *pnpm-workspace.yaml*: Add the package path to the `packages` array.

**Conditional updates:**

 -  If the package is a web framework integration: Update
    *docs/manual/integration.md*.
 -  If the package implements `KvStore`: Update *docs/manual/kv.md*.
 -  If the package implements `MessageQueue`: Update *docs/manual/mq.md*.
 -  If the package is published to JSR: Add JSR link to the `REFERENCES` data
    in *docs/.vitepress/config.mts* (note: only JSR links are added here,
    not npm links).

**Optional updates:**

 -  If special dependencies are needed: Add to `imports` in root *deno.json*.
 -  If using pnpm catalog for dependency management: Add to `catalog` in
    *pnpm-workspace.yaml*.

### Dependency management

Fedify uses two package managers:

 -  **Deno**: For Deno-based packages.  The lockfile is *deno.lock*.
 -  **pnpm**: For Node.js-based packages.  The lockfile is *pnpm-lock.yaml*.

Both lockfiles are committed to the repository to ensure reproducible builds and
consistent dependency resolution across all environments.  When you add, update,
or remove dependencies, you must commit the updated lockfile(s) along with your
changes.

To update the Deno lockfile, run:

~~~~ bash
deno task install
~~~~

To update the pnpm lockfile, run:

~~~~ bash
pnpm install
~~~~

When reviewing pull requests, please check that lockfile changes are included
for any dependency-related changes.

### Pull request builds

Each pull request is automatically built and published to the JSR and npm
registries as a pre-release.  You can test the pull request by installing
the pre-release version of the Fedify library.  The version number of
the pre-release version consists of the base version number, the pull request
number, the build number, and the commit hash, which looks like
`1.2.3-pr.456.789+abcdef01`.  You can find the exact version number in
the comment left by the build process in the pull request.

### Development environment

Fedify uses [Deno] as the main development environment.  Therefore, you need to
install Deno to hack on Fedify.

> [!TIP]
> If you use [mise-en-place], a dev tools/env vars manager and a task runner,
> you can easily install Deno, [Node.js], and [Bun] with following commands:
>
> ~~~~ bash
> mise trust
> mise install
> ~~~~

The recommended editor for Fedify is [Visual Studio Code] with
the [Deno extension] installed.  Or you can use any editor that supports Deno;
see the [*Set Up Your Environment* section][1] in the Deno manual.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Fedify heavily depends on code generation, so you need to run
> `deno task codegen` before coding or testing.

Assuming you have Deno and Visual Studio Code installed, you can open
the repository in Visual Studio Code and get ready to hack on Fedify by running
the following commands at the *root* of the repository:

~~~~ bash
deno task codegen
code .
~~~~

Note that the `deno task codegen` command is required to run only once at
very first time, or when you update the code generation scripts.   Otherwise,
you can skip the command and just run:

~~~~ bash
code .
~~~~

Since this is a monorepo, you can also work on individual packages by
navigating to their directories and using package-specific tasks.

Immediately after running the `code .` command, Visual Studio Code will open
the repository, and you can start hacking on Fedify.  If you encounter the
following message:

> Do you want to install recommended 'Deno' extension from denoland for
> this repository?

Please click the *Install* button to install the Deno extension.

[mise-en-place]: https://mise.jdx.dev/
[Visual Studio Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/
[Deno extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno
[1]: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment/

### Running the Fedify CLI

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify CLI, you can run
`deno task cli` command from the root, or `deno task -f @fedify/cli run`
command.  For example, if you want to test the `fedify lookup` subcommand,
you can run the following command:

~~~~ bash
deno task cli lookup @fedify@hollo.social
~~~~

Or directly:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/cli run lookup @fedify@hollo.social
~~~~

> [!TIP]
>
> Unlike the Fedify library, the Fedify CLI does not have to be tested with
> Node.js and Bun; you can test the CLI with Deno only.

#### Running the tests

If you want to test your changes in the Fedify library, you can run
the following command from the root:

~~~~ bash
deno task test
~~~~

Or you can test a specific package:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/fedify test
~~~~

You can use `--filter` option to run a specific test.  For example, if you
want to run the `verifyRequest` test:

~~~~ bash
deno task -f @fedify/fedify test --filter verifyRequest
~~~~

If the tests pass, you should run `deno task test-all` command to test
all packages with Deno, Node.js, and [Bun]:

~~~~ bash
deno task test-all
~~~~

To test individual packages with specific runtimes:

~~~~ bash
# Test with Node.js
deno task test:node

# Test with Bun
deno task test:bun
~~~~

Of course, Node.js and Bun should be installed on your system to run the tests
with Node.js and Bun.

> [!TIP]
> If you use [mise-en-place], a dev tools/env vars manager and a task runner,
> you can easily install Deno, [Node.js], and [Bun] with a single command:
>
> ~~~~ bash
> mise install
> ~~~~

### Building the docs

If you want to change the Fedify docs, you would like to preview the changes
in the browser.  To do that, you need to install [Node.js] and [pnpm] first.
Then you can run the following commands at the *docs/* directory:

~~~~ bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
~~~~

Once the development server is running, you can open your browser and navigate
to *http://localhost:5173/* to view the docs.
